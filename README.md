# iLogic Rules For Inventor
I have worked with CAD systems for many years. Most of them contain built-in automation tools. In Autodesk Inventor, this is the iLogic add-on, which allows you to automate routine processes with out-of-the-box functions and Inventor API. The native language of this tool is VB.NET.
I have written quite a few simple iLogic scripts for myself and on requests, but I can only publish a small part of them.
